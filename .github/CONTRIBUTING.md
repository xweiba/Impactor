# Contributing

Impactor is a sideloading app meant to be used on stock versions, to keep compatibility we have to utililize stock features to keep it working. As such, we have specific contribution rules in place to maintain this and Impactors integrity.

## Rules

- **No usage of any exploits of any kind**.
- **No contributions related to retrieving any signing certificates owned by companies**.
- **Modifying any hardcoded links should be discussed before changing**.
- **If you're planning on making a large contribution, please [make an issue](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Impactor/issues) beforehand**.
- **Your contributions should be licensed appropriately**. 
- **Typo contributions are okay**, just make sure they are appropriate.
- **Code cleaning contributions are okay**.

## Contributing to Impactor

The project is seperated in multiple modules, all serve single or multiple uses depending on their importance.

### Building

Building is going to be a bit convoluted for each platform, each having their own unique specifications, but the best reference for building should be looking at how [GitHub actions](./.github/workflows/build.yml) does it.

You need:
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/).
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (and a c++ compiler).

```sh
# Building / testing GUI
cargo run --bin plumeimpactor
# Building / texting CLI
cargo run --bin plumesign -- <args>
```

Extra requirements are shown below for building if you don't have these already, and trust me, it is convoluted.

#### Linux Requirements

```sh
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libclang-dev pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxkbcommon-dev libexpat1-dev libtiff-dev

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install clang-devel pkg-config gtk3-devel libpng-devel libjpeg-devel mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel libxkbcommon-devel expat-devel libtiff-devel
```

#### macOS Requirements

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/).

#### Windows Requirements

- [Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022).
- Windows 10/11 SDK.

### Contributing

- Make sure your contributions stay isolated in their own branch, and not `main`.
- When contributing don't be afraid of any reviewers requesting changes or judging how you wrote something, it's all to keep the project clean and tidy.
